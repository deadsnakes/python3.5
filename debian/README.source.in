README.source for python@VER@
---------------------------
The package uses the "3.0 (quilt)" source format so patches recorded in
debian/patches/series are applied automatically. However, since some patches
might modify `configure.in` without also patching `configure` (which is
generated from `configure.in`, so that would be pointless), `debian/rules`
provides a `patch` target that regenerates `configure`. The build process will
perfom this step automatically if required, however.

This package uses pristine-tar [1] and a custom-written support script [2] to
allow reconstruction of the original source tarballs from the repository. To
reconstruct an original tarball from the repository:

$ deadsnakes-pristine-tar checkout <tarball name>

This will re-create the tarball and place it in the parent directory.
